                <div class="content"><p>Six ghosts lay in Hungarian mud, and the mud was their best friend.</p>
<p>It concealed them better than any camouflage—cold, greasy, smelling of diesel fuel and rotting leaves. Two hours without movement. Two hours in thermal insulation suits that transformed a human body into a temperature signature indistinguishable from the surrounding environment. Two hours of controlled breathing—four seconds inhale, seven seconds exhale—so that even the vapor from one's mouth would not betray the position.</p>
<p>Six shadows. Six names that did not exist.</p>
<p>"Volk" lay on the left flank, his massive body somehow pressed into a shallow depression between the roots of a fallen oak. The "Gyurza" rested in a thigh holster—here, at this distance, it was of no use, but "Volk" never parted with it. Instead of the pistol, before him lay a "Val" with an integrated suppressor, wrapped in camouflage strips to the point of complete loss of recognizability.</p>
<p>"Sych" and "Bur" controlled the right flank—two silhouettes merged with the shrubbery so tightly that even a third-generation thermal imager would have passed them by. Their specialty was "room clearing." When it began—and it would begin—they would enter first.</p>
<p>"Ten'" lay in the rear guard, three hundred meters behind the main group. His task—to ensure the withdrawal. Or not ensure it, if everything went according to the bad scenario. In that case, "Ten'" would become the group's last voice, transmitting coordinates for the "final solution." All six knew what that meant. No one discussed it.</p>
<p>"List" lay in the center of the group, on a small elevation that provided an ideal view of the station's western perimeter. The SVLK-14 "Sumrak" before him seemed an extension of his own body—long, motionless, patient. The "Dedal" optics with twelve-fold magnification transformed the distant figures of terrorists into fist-sized targets. Seventeen targets inside the perimeter. "List" knew each one by face.</p>
<p>Beside "List," shoulder to shoulder, lay "Poruchik."</p>
<p>Even now, in the mud, in waiting, a hair's breadth from death, there was something... different about him. Not military. The other five were perfect instruments—honed, emotionless, functional. "Poruchik" was an instrument that remembered it had once been a human being. And—what was more important—intended to remain one.</p>
<p>The "Vintorez" before him lay like a faithful dog. The VSS—"Vintovka Snayperskaya Spetsialnaya"—a weapon for work at short and medium distances. A nine-millimeter subsonic cartridge. An integrated suppressor. The sound of the shot—like a dry cough. At one hundred meters—absolute lethality with complete absence of sound signature.</p>
<p>The perfect instrument for what was about to happen.</p>
<p>In "List's" scope, a symbol blinked.</p>
<p>A tiny yellow icon in the corner of the optical field—where ordinary optics would show only darkness. But the "Sumrak" had long ceased to be an ordinary rifle. An integrated communication system, a satellite channel, military-grade encryption. Officially, such technology did not exist. Officially, many things did not exist.</p>
<p>"List" barely noticeably turned his head. His lips—cracked, covered with camouflage makeup—curved into something resembling a smile. He extended his hand and touched "Poruchik's" shoulder. Lightly. Almost tenderly.</p>
<p>"For you," he pronounced with lips alone, without sound.</p>
<p>"Poruchik" glanced at the screen hidden beneath his sleeve. A thin strip of flexible display sewn into the fabric of the coverall—another ghost technology from the arsenal of people who did not exist.</p>
<p>On the screen, letters glowed:</p>
<p>MESSAGE FORWARDED FROM MOBILE NETWORK
"We love you. JG."</p>
<p>Three words. Eighteen thousand kilometers. Several satellites, a dozen relay stations, an abyss of encryption—and at the end of this chain, a woman in a house on a cliff, with three lives beneath her heart, sending love into the void, not knowing where exactly that void was located.</p>
<p>"Poruchik" smiled.</p>
<p>It was a strange smile—too soft for a face covered with combat makeup and mud. Too human for a man lying four hundred meters from a nuclear reactor seized by terrorists.</p>
<p>His fingers—those same fingers that in a few hours would be pressing the trigger—quickly ran across the touch panel:</p>
<p>"Love you, miss you, back home soon. MG."</p>
<p>Send.</p>
<p>The message went into the ether, broke apart into data packets, ascended to the satellites, and rushed across the ocean—to where Jane Golitsyna was probably reading "The Little Prince" aloud to three boys who had not yet been born.</p>
<p>"Poruchik"—Mark—adjusted the "Vintorez" before him. Twenty SP-5 cartridges. Each one—someone's death. Possibly.</p>
<p>He raised his eyes.</p>
<p>"Paks-2" towered before them in the night darkness—a concrete leviathan entangled in perimeter lights. Two cooling towers—gigantic truncated cones—thrust into the sky like the fingers of a dead giant. Steam rose from them, white on black, creating the illusion of breathing. The station lived. The reactors worked. Seventeen people inside kept their fingers on switches capable of turning half of Europe into an exclusion zone.</p>
<p>Seventy-two hours, they had said. Fourteen remained.</p>
<p>"List" barely noticeably moved the barrel of the "Sumrak," tracking the movement of a sentry on the roof of the administrative building. The eighth target. "List" already knew how he would fall—backward and to the left, in an arc, because a .408 CheyTac caliber bullet leaves the body no choice.</p>
<p>"Volk" on the left flank checked his chronometer. Soon. Very soon.</p>
<p>"Poruchik" lay motionless, gazing at the station, and thought about Jane. About how she sat in the chair by the window, her hand resting on her belly. About how she read books aloud that the boys could not yet hear. About how the light fell on her hair—gold upon gold. "Poruchik" closed his eyes for a second. One second—an impermissible luxury in his profession. But he permitted himself this luxury, because in that second everything fit: the scent of her hair, the sound of her laughter, the warmth of her body beside him in the enormous bed in the house on the cliff.</p>
<p>Then he opened his eyes. And once again became what he had to be. A ghost.</p>
<p>In the earpiece, there was a click. Once. Twice. Three times.</p>
<p>The signal.</p>
<p>"Poruchik" placed his finger on the trigger.</p>
<p>"Paks-2" waited.</p></div>
