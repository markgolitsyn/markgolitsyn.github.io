                <div class="content"><p>The lake was different.</p>
<p>Not the lake in Hungary—another one, nameless, lost somewhere in the folds of the Carpathian foothills. But the water lay just as motionlessly, a black mirror, and the stars reflected in it just the same, and it seemed that time had coiled into a ring, returning everything to the beginning.</p>
<p>Only the bonfire was different. The smoke rose upward—black, sticky, greasy. Not the cheerful smoke of a campfire, smelling of resin and pine needles. Funeral smoke. Ancient smoke. Smoke that humanity had known since the first warrior failed to return from the first hunt.</p>
<p>Three bodies lay on the shore, covered with tarpaulin.
"Poruchik." "Volk." "List."</p>
<hr />
<p>The operation had been flawless. As always.</p>
<p>A storage facility for spent nuclear waste—a concrete bunker in an industrial zone, seized by a group that officials would later call "unidentified terrorists." Fourteen militants. Eleven hostages—engineers, technicians, one truck driver who happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.</p>
<p>The team entered at 02:47 local time.</p>
<p>By 02:54 it was all over.</p>
<p>"Volk" worked as always—heavily, relentlessly, with that particular grace that only very large men can afford. His "Gyurza"—the same one, with the worn grip—never left its holster. Here the "Val" sufficed.</p>
<p>"List" controlled the perimeter from the roof of an adjacent building. "Sumrak" remained silent—not a single target emerged outside. Perfect isolation.</p>
<p>"Poruchik" led the team through the bunker corridors; the "Vintorez" coughed dryly and precisely. One shot—one body. Economy elevated to an art form.</p>
<p>By 02:59 the last terrorist lay motionless on the concrete floor.
By 03:00 the hostages were gathered in the central room—frightened, but alive.</p>
<p>Perfect.
As always.</p>
<hr />
<p>No one noticed the tripwire.</p>
<p>Later, reconstructing the chronology, analysts would determine: it had been installed six hours before the assault, in a technical corridor between the main storage area and the emergency exit. Thin fishing line, nearly invisible. A thermobaric charge—improvised, but competent.</p>
<p>A worker—an elderly engineer named Mihály, thirty-two years of service, two grandchildren in Budapest—was walking toward the exit. "Poruchik" was checking the rooms behind him. "Volk" was covering the group of hostages. "List" was already descending from the roof to join the evacuation.</p>
<p>Mihály stumbled. The line went taut.</p>
<hr />
<p>A thermobaric explosion is unlike an ordinary one.</p>
<p>First—the flash. Blinding, white, like a second sun. Then—the pressure wave, devouring the oxygen from the air, turning lungs into useless sacks of tissue. And only then—the fire. Fire that has nothing to burn, because everything is already dead.</p>
<p>The corridor collapsed.</p>
<p>"Poruchik" was three meters from the epicenter.
"Volk"—five meters, shielding two hostages with his body.
"List"—seven meters, at the threshold of a side passage.
Mihály vanished. Simply vanished—nothing remained that could be buried.</p>
<hr />
<p>The team carried out the bodies.</p>
<p>It was difficult. "Volk" weighed over a hundred kilograms even without equipment. "Poruchik" and "List"—lighter, but a dead body is always heavier than a living one. Everyone who has carried comrades knows this.</p>
<p>"Sych" and "Bur" worked in silence. "Ten" provided cover, though there was no one to cover against—the terrorists were dead, the hostages in shock, local services would not arrive for at least an hour.</p>
<p>Through the forest. Through the fields. To the lake.</p>
<p>To the final bonfire.</p>
<hr />
<p>The firewood was stacked in a well pattern—the old way, as grandfathers had taught, as it had been done for thousands of years before them. Deadfall, kindling, thick logs on top. Three bodies—side by side, shoulder to shoulder, as they had once lain by another fire, listening to tall tales and clinking faceted glasses.</p>
<p>"Sych" took out a flask. Not vodka—alcohol. Medical, pure, ninety-six percent. He splashed it on the wood. The smell struck the nostrils—sharp, hospital-like, out of place.</p>
<p>"Bur" struck a match. The fire caught instantly—greedy, hungry, impatient. It engulfed the entire pyre, surged upward, toward the sky, toward the stars, which looked down with the same indifference with which they had looked for thousands of years.</p>
<p>The smoke came immediately. Black. Sticky. Greasy. It rose in a column—thick, tangible, alive with some terrible life. It obscured the stars one by one, as if someone invisible were extinguishing candles on a memorial table.</p>
<p>"Sych" stood motionless, gazing into the fire.
"Bur"—beside him, his face in the firelight seeming carved from stone.
"Ten"—slightly behind, in the darkness, where he belonged.</p>
<p>Three living. Three dead.</p>
<hr />
<p>"To 'Poruchik,'" said "Sych" at last.
He raised the flask, took a drink, passed it to "Bur."</p>
<p>"To 'Volk.'"
Another sip. The flask passed to "Ten."</p>
<p>"To 'List.'"
The alcohol burned the throat. "Ten" did not wince.</p>
<p>The flask returned to "Sych." He looked at it, then at the fire.
"To all who departed before us. 'Demon.' 'Terek.' 'Svarog.' 'Banshi.'"</p>
<p>He poured the remaining alcohol into the fire. The flames surged—furious, hungry—and subsided.
The smoke continued to rise. Black. Sticky. Greasy.</p>
<p>It obscured the stars, one by one, as if concluding a sorrowful tale. A tale of people who did not exist. Of ghosts who walked through walls. Of shadows who protected the world, asking nothing in return.</p>
<p>"Poruchik." Mark Golitsyn. Husband. Father of three sons. A man who found love when he had already ceased to hope. A man who had time to become happy.
"Volk." Call sign—the only name that mattered. Large, loud, alive. A man who could laugh so that walls shook. A man who shielded strangers with his body without a moment's hesitation.
"List." Sniper. Patient as a rock, precise as mathematics. A man who saw the world through the optics of "Sumrak" and found it—despite everything—beautiful.</p>
<p>The smoke rose. The stars went out.</p>
<hr />
<p>Somewhere far away, across the ocean, in a house on a cliff above San Francisco Bay, a woman woke in the middle of the night.</p>
<p>Jane Golitsyna sat up in bed, pressing her hand to her chest. Her heart was pounding. Her palms were wet.</p>
<p>She did not know why.</p>
<p>She looked at the empty half of the bed. Mark was at a "charity event"—so he had said, and she had not asked. She never asked. She picked up her phone. No messages. She dialed his number. Rings. Rings. Rings. Voicemail. Jane set the phone on the nightstand.</p>
<p>She looked at the watch on her wrist—the same one, with diamonds, with a serial number on the back.</p>
<p>Then she rose and went to the nursery. Three boys slept in their beds. Sasha lay sprawled like a star, having kicked off his blanket. Kolya was curled in a ball, hugging a stuffed bear. Mitya lay motionless, and even in sleep his face appeared concentrated.</p>
<p>Jane adjusted the blanket over Sasha. Stroked Kolya's head. Looked at Mitya with a long, long gaze.</p>
<p>Then she sat in the chair by the window and began to wait. She did not know what she was waiting for. But she knew—somewhere in the world, something had broken.</p>
<hr />
<p>The smoke over the lake finally dissipated. The bonfire was burning down—the coals glowed dimly, like dying stars. Three bodies had turned to ash, the ash had mingled with the earth, the earth would accept it, as it had accepted for thousands of years.</p>
<p>"Sych" collected the ash into three small containers. Titanium, hermetically sealed, without markings.
One—for "Poruchik's" family.
Two others—for the memorial wall that officially does not exist, in a building that is marked on no map.</p>
<p>"We're leaving," said "Sych."
They left. Like shadows. As always.</p>
<p>The lake remained. The stars returned—one by one, as if the world had decided that the mourning was over.</p>
<p>But those who knew "Poruchik," "Volk," and "List"—they would remember.</p>
<p>They would remember the black smoke obscuring the stars.
They would remember three glasses and a piece of black bread.
They would remember the people who did not exist—and who were more real than all the rest of the world.</p></div>
