                <div class="content"><p>The mirror was old — a silver lid with engraving, worn from a thousand touches. Grandmother's. The only thing Lena had taken with her when she left Vladivostok eight years ago.</p>
<p>She looked at her reflection and thought about the fact that she was twenty-six, that she had already sat through this shift for nine hours, and that the coffee in the embassy cafeteria was getting worse with each passing year.</p>
<p>The telephone rang. Internal line. A call redirected from the main switchboard. Lena snapped the mirror shut, set it aside, and answered the call.</p>
<p>"Embassy of the Russian Federation, my name is Elena, please introduce yourself."</p>
<p>The voice was automatic, rehearsed through thousands of such calls. Lost passports. Visa questions. Sometimes — hysterics from tourists stranded at the airport.</p>
<p>A second of silence.</p>
<p>Lena had already opened her mouth to repeat the greeting when a female voice uttered a single word:</p>
<p><b>"Vympel."</b></p>
<p>The world stopped.</p>
<p>Lena felt a chill run down her spine — not fear, no. Something else. Something she had been taught three years ago, in a room without windows, by instructors without names.</p>
<p>"This word you will hear, perhaps, never. But if you do hear it — everything else ceases to exist."</p>
<p>Her fingers were already moving across the keyboard — quickly, precisely, without a single unnecessary command. Activation protocol. Voice identification. Biometric analysis in real time.</p>
<p>A face appeared on the screen.</p>
<p>A woman. Forty-something. Blonde — natural, this was evident from the texture, from the way light fell on the hair. Slender, fit, with the posture of a person accustomed to command. Sculptural cheekbones. Lips that probably knew how to smile — but not now.</p>
<p>And the eyes.</p>
<p>Blue. Piercing. Eyes that had seen something terrible and had not looked away.</p>
<p>"This woman sounds as if she is ready to give her life for her children right now," thought Lena.</p>
<p>She lowered her gaze below — to where the system had already displayed the dossier.</p>
<p>GOLITSYNA, Jane. née Smith.<br>
Status: PROTECTED.<br>
Linked file: GOLITSYN, Mark. Callsign: PORUCHIK.<br>
Status: KIA. Operation [REDACTED]. Date: [REDACTED].</p>
<p>Lena stared at the screen.</p>
<p>"Just as her husband gave his for someone else's..."</p>
<p>She closed her eyes for a second. One second — an impermissible luxury. Then opened them and switched to English.</p>
<p>"The code, please."</p>
<p>The voice on the line did not waver:</p>
<p>"Seven. Four. Two. Nine. Zero. Three. Eight. One."</p>
<p>Lena entered the digits. The system flashed green.</p>
<p>CONFIRMED. EXTRACTION PROTOCOL ALPHA. PRIORITY: MAXIMUM.</p>
<p>Her fingers were already typing commands — one after another, activating a chain that would now awaken people at three different points in the city. People who had been waiting for such a call at every moment. People who, perhaps, had hoped it would never come.</p>
<p>"Mrs. Golitsyna," said Lena, and her own voice sounded different now. Firmer. Older. "Be ready in exactly twelve minutes."</p>
<p>She watched the timer in the corner of the screen. 12:00. 11:59. 11:58.</p>
<p>"There will be two cars. Sedan and minivan. Black. No markings."</p>
<p>11:52. 11:51.</p>
<p>"Get out of the house to the curb in eleven minutes. Take your sons. Take nothing else."</p>
<p>A pause on the other end. Brief. Almost imperceptible.</p>
<p>"When you reach the curb, tie the shoe of one of your sons."</p>
<p>11:41. 11:40.</p>
<p>"This is the signal. This tells our people that you are not under duress. That this is your choice."</p>
<p>Lena heard the breathing on the other end of the line. Even. Controlled. The breathing of a person who had already made a decision.</p>
<p>"Whatever happens — don't pay attention to anything. Cars, people, sounds. Nothing. Your only goal is to get inside of the minivan. The side door will be open."</p>
<p>11:22. 11:21.</p>
<p>"When the door closes behind you..."</p>
<p>Lena paused. Not for dramatic effect. Simply to make certain that the next words would be heard.</p>
<p>"...you are out of the jurisdiction. Forever."</p>
<p>Silence.</p>
<p>Then a voice — the voice of a woman with piercing blue eyes, a woman who had lost her husband and was now losing everything else in order to save her children:</p>
<p>"I understand."</p>
<p>A pause.</p>
<p>"Eleven minutes."</p>
<p>"Eleven minutes," confirmed Lena.</p>
<p>"Thank you, Elena."</p>
<p>The line disconnected.</p>
<p>Lena stared at the screen. The timer continued to run. 10:47. 10:46. 10:45.</p>
<p>In the photograph in the dossier, Jane Golitsyna was smiling. The picture was old — perhaps five years old. She stood on some veranda, flooded with sunlight, and looked somewhere beyond the frame. At someone.</p>
<p>"At him," Lena understood. "At the Poruchik."</p>
<p>She took out the mirror. Opened it. Looked at her reflection.</p>
<p>Twenty-six years old. Nine hours on shift. Bad coffee.</p>
<p>And a woman on the other end of the line who had ten minutes and forty-three seconds left to gather three children and step into the void.</p>
<p>Lena closed the mirror. She had done her job.</p>
<p>Now there was nothing left but to wait.</p></div>
